This new RStudio update is major news since I can now leverage the best of both worlds in one IDE far more easily. Let me list it out:\n I can use {reticulate} to execute code in Python using R syntax - available prior to RStudio 1.4 I can run .py files (Python scripts) within RStudio and not have to use VSCode (my second favorite text-editor/IDE)   Here’s where I’m coming from In my current role, I code in both Python and R and have to use different IDEs (VSCode and RStudio respectively). From my experience, I find certain things to be easier to do in Python and many other things far more easier to do in R. I have to say that matplotlib is by far the WORST Python library I’ve ever used1. On the other hand, {ggplot2} is simply a gorgeous library that makes plotting exceptionally easy and fun. And let me tell you that data wrangling with {dplyr} is far more intuitive than pandas2. However, where Python really shines is the sklearn library.

The biggest challenge was not really being able to see what Python objects were loaded into memory if running a Python script. Furthermore, it was annoying (to me) to have to define the virtual environment (or conda environment) to use with {reticulate}3.
