<p>My good friend (and former classmate) Rahul Sangole has a great <a href="https://rsangole.netlify.app/post/2020/10/10/reproducible-work-in-r/">blog post</a> about setting up Docker &amp; R and why he did it. It really boils down to a couple different things: reproducibility and having a consistent development environment. As a data scientist, I cannot stress the importance of reproducibility. If you can’t reproduce your results/analyses (nor can anyone else), then suffice to say, that’s a bad thing!</p>
<p>Anyways, I ran into some issues running Rahul’s Dockerfile. Specifically, I couldn’t get blogdown to work with my blog. I’m not sure if that was by design, but I wanted to “amend” his blog post with a few of my own points:</p>
<ul>
<li>using binaries instead of source files for R packages</li>
<li>using RStudio’s Package Manager instead of MRAN</li>
<li>installing Hugo (with blogdown) during the Docker image creation</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference, here’s a link to my <a href="https://github.com/nikdata/blognik/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a>.</p>
<div id="source-vs.-binary" class="section level1">
<h1>Source vs. Binary</h1>
<p>This is a key concept that I think most users going down the Docker and R path should be aware of. Simply put, a “binary” is already compiled for a given system and a “source” is not. Think of the “source” file like a set-up file that will need to be installed. On the other hand, a “binary” is the whole package that does not require installation (think copy &amp; paste of the package). Hence, when compiling a Docker image, using “binary” files as much as possible will help speed up the creation time.</p>
<p>Since binary files are already compiled for a particular system, it’s critical that you know which system you are using. For example, binary R packages constructed for Ubuntu Xenial will NOT work for RedHat.</p>
</div>
<div id="mran-vs.-rstudio-package-manager" class="section level1">
<h1>MRAN vs. RStudio Package Manager</h1>
<p>As Rahul points out in his blog, he uses <a href="https://mran.microsoft.com">MRAN</a> - Microsoft’s solution to ‘archiving’ the activity they see on CRAN. I’m not 100% certain, but I don’t think MRAN has binaries available for the different R packages. On the other hand, <a href="https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/client/#/repos/1/packages/A3">RStudio’s Package Manager</a> has <em>both</em>. Furthermore, RStudio Package Manager also has ‘snapshots’ similar to MRAN for particular days. While MRAN is more comprehensive and uses actual dates in their URL, RStudio does offer a compelling alternative.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-hugo" class="section level1">
<h1>Installing Hugo</h1>
<p>This one took me a while to figure out, but the end solution was much simpler than the rabbit holes I went down. Basically, I just need to have blogdown install it for me after it (blogdown) was installed.</p>
<pre><code>WORKDIR /home/rstudio/bin/
RUN R -e &quot;options(blogdown.hugo.dir = &#39;/home/rstudio/bin&#39;); blogdown::install_hugo(version = &#39;0.70.0&#39;)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The WORKDIR argument is key as it creates that folder location and sets the working directory to it. This is the location where the function <code>blogdown::install_hugo()</code> will install to.</p>
</div>
<div id="success" class="section level1">
<h1>Success</h1>
<p>This Dockerfile creates an image that works on my machine quite well. I also was able to get it to work on my work machine. I am a bit troubled at the overall size of the Docker image - which for me was a bit over 5 GB.</p>
</div>
