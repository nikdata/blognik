<p>As many data scientists who are actively looking for a new job may know, one of the more exciting (or dreaded) parts of the interview process is the coding assessment. For those that may not know, the coding assessment can vary widely from one company to another. Questions can be simple as writing a simple SQL script or as complex as writing abstract code to ‘productionize’ a machine learning model. Preparation can be daunting and if you’re like me, you might feel lost as to where to even begin! But fear not, there are lots of resources to help you prepare for coding interviews such as <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> or <a href="https://www.leetcode.com">Leet Code</a>.</p>
<p>One of the companies that interviewed me, asked a coding question that was - well - dumb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sort the following array in ascending order:</p>
<p>[(5, 2, 1), (3, 2), (8, 3, 5, 1)]</p>
<p>Possible answers could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>[(1, 2, 5), (2, 3), (1, 3, 5, 8)]</li>
<li>[(2, 1, 0), (1, 0), (3, 1, 2, 0)]</li>
</ul>
