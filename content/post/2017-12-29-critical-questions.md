As a data scientist at a Fortune 500 company, I am always amazed at how quickly some of my colleagues (not ones on my team) are eager to dive right into model development and analysis. Part of this, I think, is simply human nature. Or it could be that this is a trait of typical engineers - trying to solve a 'problem' first. Even though I'm an engineer by education, I am quite lazy. I don't necessarily want to take on extra work if it is not critical or essential.

### So what's the solution?

Remember from the days past (look back to your pre-high school English classes) where you may have had to construct arguments answering the following questions:

* Who
* What
* Where
* When
* Why
* How

Much of this sounds like common sense, but if you think about it closely, you may end up realizing that many folks think they know the answer to these questions, but in reality, few have actually articulated the answer.

### The Proper Order

Some 'experts' (including myself) will tell you which order you should follow. Here's the order that has often worked for me:

1. Why
2. What
3. Who
4. When
5. How
6. Where

#### Why This Order

This sequence works well mainly because it begins its focus on why do the activity in the first place at all. Data analysis may sound easy and cheap, but it can be time consuming and lead you on a wild goose chase. Before beginning any activity, really think about why it is needed in the first place.

### Example Questions

Here are some examples of questions that I ask:

* Why are we doing this analysis?
* What are the business objectives that are met with this project?
* Who is requesting this information and why are they requesting it?
* What is the end game with the analysis? For example, if I give them XYZ data, how does that data help them achieve what they are trying to accomplish?
* When does the analysis need to be complete?
* What are the deliverables and how will the deliverables be measured?
* Where is the information that is needed to achieve the objectives?

There are hundreds of questions that can be asked and I have only highlighted a handful of them.

### What About a Project Plan?

Great question! And the answer is YES! Project plans are intimidating, in my opinion. And I think it has to do with the fact that folks think of this as a formal document. It does not have to be! Rather, a quick document with the appropriate questions is sufficient.

### Moral of the Story

The moral here is that before embarking on any data analysis, always ask the main questions (why, what, who, when, how, where). The last thing anyone wants to do in a workplace is go on a wild goose hunt (or down the rabbit hole) and end up not achieving anything!
