<p>In my PREDICT 454 class, one of the R challenges that our professor wanted us to undertake involved creating a simple function that ‘acted’ like the venerable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball">Magic 8 Ball</a>. So let’s get to it!</p>
<div id="prerequisite" class="section level2">
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The function must output one of the following texts:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>‘I don’t see that happening.’</li>
<li>‘You must be dreaming.’</li>
<li>‘Chances are good.’</li>
<li>‘If you work hard and stay focused, then this might happen.’</li>
<li>‘When the sun shines, it shines on your face.’</li>
<li>‘Definitely going to happen!’</li>
<li>‘Take some time to think about it.’</li>
<li>‘This is not a good idea!’</li>
<li>‘This is a great idea!’</li>
<li>‘Cannot be determined at this time. Try Again!’</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Add an optional feature in which the user can include the seed number</p></li>
<li><p>The function should be called <strong>magic.8ball()</strong> and if a seed is to be used, then the function could called as <strong>magic.8ball(123)</strong></p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Function Definition</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>magic.8ball &lt;- function(x.seed) {
  # define messages
  msg1 &lt;- &quot;I don&#39;t see that happening.&quot;
  msg2 &lt;- &#39;You must be dreaming.&#39;
  msg3 &lt;- &#39;Chances are good.&#39;
  msg4 &lt;- &#39;If you work hard and stay focused, then this might happen.&#39;
  msg5 &lt;- &#39;When the sun shines, it shines on your face.&#39;
  msg6 &lt;- &#39;Definitely going to happen!&#39;
  msg7 &lt;- &#39;Take some time to think about it.&#39;
  msg8 &lt;- &#39;This is not a good idea!&#39;
  msg9 &lt;- &#39;This is a great idea!&#39;
  msg10 &lt;- &#39;Cannot be determined at this time.  Try Again!&#39;
  msg_list &lt;- list(msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4, msg5, msg6, msg7, msg8, msg9, msg10)

  if(missing(x.seed)) {
    x &lt;- sample(1:10,1)
  } else {
    set.seed(x.seed)
    x &lt;- sample(1:10,1)
  }
  return(print(msg_list[x]))
}</code></pre>

<h3>Function Results</h3>

<h4>Function with random seed</h4>
<pre class="r"><code>magic.8ball()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;This is a great idea!&quot;</code></pre>

## [1] &quot;Chances are good.&quot;</code></pre>
</div>

<div id="function-explanation" class="section level3">
<h3>Function Explanation</h3>
<p>For the most part, this function is quite simple. Although there are numerous ways to derive this solution, I felt it was easier to define each message into a variable and then store all of the variables in a list. Then, the function would simply sample an integer between 1 and 10 (since there are 10 messages) and recall the corresponding list member for display to the end user.</p>
<p>The slight twist in this example was the user-defined seed. In order ot do this correctly, I employed the command <code>missing</code> to check and see if the user had originally entered a value in the function call. If none is there, then the function uses a random seed and if the user did enter some number, then it sets the seed accordingly.</p>
<p>Hope all that makes sense. Let me know if you have any questions!</p>
