When I started my role as a data scientist at Deere & Company, I had several of my colleagues ask me how I got my job, what was it like being a data scientist, what do I really do as a data scientist, etc. First off, I was flattered. In a way, I felt like I had achieved rock star status and was the envy of the world. The reality is that being a data scientist is just like any other job. I enjoy what I do, but at the end of the day, I get paid so I can provide for my family and help put food on the table.

Going through Northwestern's Predictive Analytics (soon to be renamed Data Science) program, no one really talked about how life was really like once you became a data scientist. Allow me to reword - "what's a data scientist really do on a day to day basis?"
