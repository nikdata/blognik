I'm Nikhil Agarwal (Nik) and this is my blog for my random musings on life and data.

Currently, I'm a principal data scientist at [Makusafe](https://www.makusafe.com), where I focus on predictive analytics on motion & location classification with our wearable device. Prior to MakuSafe, I was a data scientist in varying rolest at [John Deere](https://www.johndeere.com) focusing on machine & customer behavior modeling, market basket analysis, and anamoly detection on machine usage. Early on in my career, I was a manufacturing engineer focused on optimal assembly line work distribution/allocation along with process optimization.

Outside of work, my interests include:
- stats & data analysis
- road biking
- photography (DSLR & drone)
- taking adventurous hikes with my family

I have a Master's degree in Data Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) and a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu).

Thanks for stopping by!
