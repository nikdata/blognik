Hi! My name is Nik and I enjoy tinkering with data.

I currently work at [John Deere](https://www.johndeere.com) as a data scientist where I develop predictive models to help our customers make better decisions on their farm operations with their John Deere machines. All content on this site express my view and not of my employer. None of the content on this site are endorsed or can be construed as an endorsement by Deere & Company.

In my spare time, I enjoy taking walks with my family, taking countless snapshots, and playing around with data & machine learning models.

I have a Master's in Data Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) and a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu).

Thanks for stopping by!
