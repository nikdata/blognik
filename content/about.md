Hello! I'm Nik Agarwal and this is my blog for my random musings on life and data.

Currently, I'm Director of Data Science at [Makusafe](https://www.makusafe.com), where I lead the data analytics and ML Ops strategies. I'm also an adjunct instructor for the University of Wisconsin - Madison leading their courses on the [Data Science & Analytics bootcamp](https://digitalskills.wisc.edu/data-science-and-analytics-bootcamp/).

Prior to MakuSafe, I was a data scientist in varying roles at [John Deere](https://www.johndeere.com) focusing on machine & customer behavior modeling, market basket analysis, and anomaly detection on machine usage. Early on in my career, I was a manufacturing engineer focused on implementation of new products to current assembly lines and an industrial engineer focusing on warehouse pick path & packaging optimizations.

Outside of work, my interests include:
- stats & data analysis
- road biking
- photography (DSLR & drone)
- traveling & hiking with my family

I have a Master's degree in Data Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) and a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu).

Thanks for stopping by!
